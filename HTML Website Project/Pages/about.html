        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>We are a team of passiaonate PC's builders that came together to bring people good PC's.
            PC building is not something we only do for business, but something we all grew up doing and loving.
            Most members of our team built their first PC's before they knew basic algebra.
            One day our founder Walter Baylee and his former sudent Jessie Blueman quit their jobs and started making
            PC's from a camper of all things.
            Quickly people picked up on their high quality PC's with handpicked components, and the rest is history.
            For years we provided PC's for personal and profesional use at every price point.
            Our colective experience, love and care for building separates us from other profit driven provides.
            You can be sure that every PC we sell is made with love and care.</p>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Every PC needs to perform and look good at resonable price point.</p>
        <p> Here at BasiCore it is our mission to provide PC's without compromises and bottlenecks.</p>
        <p>Every PC is built with care and as if we would use them ourself, which we do with all of our personal and
            store PC's.</p>
        <p>Market for PC's is filled with low storage, mistery memory, outdated components and explosive power suplies.
