# School Projects

Welcome to my repository for school projects! This repository contains a collection of projects completed during my time in school. Explore the diverse range of work undertaken during my time at school.

## Usage

Each project is stored in its own directory. Navigate to the respective directory to view the project files and documentation.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute, feel free to fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

## License

There is no licence since I remove any elements that could link/lead to my school.

Feel free to explore the projects. Happy coding!
